# ubuntu-post-installation
This Repository conntains all the littel tweaks I do usually after setting up the system. I am using a Lenovo Thinkpad x240. I recently switched to Ubuntu Gnome and I am using currently version 17.04. This means Gnome Shell as default desktop environment and Evolution as email and calendar software.

# Tested in Ubuntu Gnome 17.04

- Enable [Touch Gesture support](https://github.com/bulletmark/libinput-gestures)
  - under construction: The ideal touch configuration based on [this guide](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/OS/Gestures)
- Add `powertop --auto-tune` to startup applications
- Install tor browser bundle: `torbrowser-launcher`

# Tested in Ubuntu 16.04 (and 15.10)
## Disable Bluetooth at startup
Follow [this description in order to create a service that deactivates bluetooth at startup](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Bluetooth/Einrichtung#Deaktivierung-beim-Start)

## Application Specific Changes

### Use Firefox ProfileManager

According to [this
article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiple_profiles) it is possible to let Firefox ask for a specific
profile when launched.

In the file `/usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop` the following line needs to be changed:
```
Exec=firefox %u
```
needs to be changed to:
```
Exec=firefox --ProfileManager %u
```

## Installation of additional Software

### Install Tor Browser Bundle

Start Tor Browser when a new Network Connection is established only (see also [general infromation how to run a script when connecting to a network](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OnNetworkConnectionRunScript)):

add this script to `/etc/network/if-up.d/`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
pkill firefox
